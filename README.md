UN/LOCODE
=========

This repository is an RDF view on the UN's LOCODE, the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations,
as published by UNECE, see https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/unlocode.


Why?
----

This repository was created to expose UN/LOCODEs as Linked Data, particularly to
provide a namespace for the codes.  UNCEFACT has since begun working on providing
linked data resources themselves ([repository](https://github.com/uncefact/codes-locode/)).

This repository, in contrast, will keep track of historical codes, and provide
alignment data.


Where?
------

The [official github repository](https://github.com/ga-group/un-locode/) contains the
published datasets as well as separately maintained alignment and enrichment files.

For ease of access the latest versions of the datasets can be downloaded here:

- [un-locode.ttl](/un-locode/un-locode.ttl)
